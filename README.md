# Skin-Disease-ML-Model

This CNN-DNN model was trained on a kaggle data set (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/subirbiswas19/skin-disease-dataset) that had 8 different classification of skin disease images. This is trained across 25 epochs with training loss below 0.1 but validation loss still hovering around 1.9 which needs to be further optimized. Pls feel free to baseline this code and continue to optimize by tuning the parameters or altering the model architecture.
